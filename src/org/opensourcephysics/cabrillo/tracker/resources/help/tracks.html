		<h1><a name="track0" id="track0"></a>Tracks</h1>
		<p>A track represents a video feature that evolves over time. All interactive elements in Tracker, including the axes, measuring tools and calibration tools, are tracks.</p>
		<p>The position or shape of the feature in a single video frame is known as a <strong>step</strong>; thus, a track is a series of steps. Each step can be selected and manipulated with the mouse or keyboard. Some steps, like those for point mass tracks, have only a single moveable point, but others, like vector steps, have two end points plus a center handle point.</p>
		<p>There are several types of user-defined tracks and three measuring tools. For detailed information on a specific type, see its corresponding help topic: <a href="pointmass.html">point mass</a>, <a href="cm.html">center of mass</a>, <a href="vector.html">vector</a>, <a href="vectorsum.html">vector sum</a>, <a href="lineprofile.html">line profile</a>, <a href="rgbregion.html">rgb region</a>, <a href="particles.html">kinematic particle model</a>, <a href="particles.html">dynamic particle model</a>, <a href="systems.html">two-body system</a>, <a href="datatrack.html">external model</a>, <a href="tape.html">tape measure</a>, <a href="protractor.html">protractor</a> and <a href="circlefitter.html">circle fitter</a>.</p>
        
		<h3><a name="track1" id="track1"></a>1. Creating a track</h3>
		<p align="center">
			<img src="../help_images/track_list.gif">
		</p>
		<p>Create a new track by selecting the desired track type from the <strong>Create</strong> button menu on the toolbar or the <strong>Track|New</strong> menu on the menu bar. A newly created track is automatically selected for marking.</p>
		
        <h3><a name="track2" id="track2"></a>2. Marking a track</h3>
		<p align="center">
			<img src="../help_images/crosshair_large.gif">
		</p>
		<p>Marking a track refers to the process of defining its position on each frame in the video clip. Most tracks can be marked either manually or automatically using <a href="autotracker.html">autotracker</a>. To mark manually, hold down the <strong>shift key</strong> to display the <strong>crosshair cursor</strong> (shown above at twice actual size) and click the mouse on the feature of interest as the video automatically steps through the video clip. </p>
		<p>When marking point mass and vector tracks, you can hit the <strong>enter key</strong> instead of clicking the mouse to mark a step at the exact location of the previous step. This can be useful when marking an object at rest.</p>
<p>Marking is done in the main video view. For more accurate marking, magnify the image up to 8x using the <a href="videos.html#zoom">zoom tool</a> or by right-clicking on the video and choosing the desired zoom level.</p>
		<p align="center">
			<img src="../help_images/video_popup.gif">
		</p>
		<p>There is some variability in marking requirements for the various track types. Vector and line profile tracks require dragging rather than clicking. Point mass and vector tracks expect every step to be marked, but offset origin, calibration point pair, line profile and rgb region tracks require marking only a single frame. Center of mass, vector sum, particle model and two-body system tracks are marked automatically. For calibration sticks and tapes you can choose a preference.</p>
		<p>When creating a new point mass, vector or rgb region, the video is reset to step 0 by default. You can prevent this reset by unchecking the <strong>Auto-reset to step 0</strong> box in the Tracks tab of the <a href="interface.html#prefs">preferences dialog</a>.</p>
<p>If you prefer that the video not automatically step forward while marking you can uncheck the <strong>Autostep</strong> option in the Track menu for point mass and vector tracks.</p>
        
		<h3><a name="trackmenu" id="trackmenu"></a>3. Track buttons and menus</h3>
		<p align="center">
			<img src="../help_images/pointmass_menu.gif">
		</p>
		<p>Every track has a <strong>track button</strong> that shows its name, color and footprint, and a <strong>track menu</strong> with items for setting its properties. Track buttons are displayed on both the <a href="interface.html#toolbar">toolbar</a> and the <a href="tracks.html#trackControl">track control</a>. Track menus can be accessed by (a) clicking the track button, (b) choosing the track from the <strong>Tracks</strong> menu on the menu bar, or (c) right-clicking the main video view and choosing the track from the <strong>Tracks</strong> popup menu.</p>

		<h3><a name="trackControl" id="trackControl"></a>4. Track control</h3>
		<p align="center">
			<img src="../help_images/track_control.gif">
        </p>
		<p>The <strong>track control</strong> displays a track button for each user-created track. This makes it easy to select tracks and provides ready access to all track menus.</p>
		<p>To show the track control, click the track control button <img src="../help_images/track_control_button.gif" align="absmiddle"> on the <a href="interface.html#toolbar">toolbar</a>.</p>

		<h3><a name="track5" id="track5"></a>5. Selecting a track</h3>
		<p>Tracks can be marked or edited only when they are selected. The track button of the currently selected track is displayed on the lower tier of the <a href="interface.html#toolbar">toolbar</a>.</p>
		<p align="center">
			<img src="../help_images/name_footprint1.gif">
        </p>
        <p>To select a different track, click its track button on the <a href="tracks.html#trackControl">track control</a> or select one of its steps in the video view.</p>

        <h3><a name="track6" id="track6"></a>6. Cloning, copying and importing tracks</h3>
		<p>Make a duplicate copy of an existing track using the <strong>Clone</strong> item in the <strong>Create</strong> menu or the <strong>Track|New</strong> menu.</p>
		<p align="center">
        	<img src="../help_images/clone.gif">
        </p>
		<p>Copy a track from one tab to another by selecting the track and copying it to the clipboard using the <strong>Edit|Copy</strong> menu item, then pasting using the <strong>Edit|Paste</strong> item.</p>
		<p>Since the tape measure and axes are tracks, they can also be copied. When pasted, they replace the existing tape or axes in the tab. When no track is selected, the entire tracker panel (video clip, coordinate system and tracks) is copied.</p>
		<p>Tracks can also be imported directly from saved tracker files into an open tab using the <strong>File|Import</strong> menu item. For more information see <a href="datafile.html#import">tracker files</a>.</p>
		
        <h3><a name="track7" id="track7"></a>7. Customizing and documenting a track</h3>
		<p>Every track is identified by its <strong>name</strong>, <strong>color</strong>, <strong>footprint</strong> (visible shape) and<strong> notes</strong> (descriptive comments). Newly created tracks are assigned default values for the first three properties that depend on the type of track. For example, a point mass might initially be named &rdquo;mass A&rdquo; and be drawn as a red diamond.</p>
		<p align="center">
			<img src="../help_images/name_footprint1.gif" alt="Toolbar track name and footprint" border="0">
		</p>
		<p>A track button showing the name, footprint and color of the track are displayed on the toolbar when the track is selected. To change the default values, click the track button and choose the <strong>Name...</strong>, <strong>Color..</strong>. or <strong>Footprint</strong> item from the track menu.</p>
