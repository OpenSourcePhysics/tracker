<h1><a name="trz0" id="trz0"></a>Tracker Projects</h1>
		<p>A <strong>Tracker project</strong> consists of the following  resources zipped together in a single file with extension<strong> .trz</strong>.</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>one or more Tracker tab files and associated videos </li>
		  <li>an html information page with  title, description, thumbnail image and metadata (authors, contact, keywords) for search and display in the <a href="library_browser.html">Library Browser</a></li>
		  <li>optional support documentation in PDF, HTML or other format displayable in a default desktop viewer</li>
		  <li>optional external link or separate html file for display in the <a href="library_browser.html">Library Browser</a></li>
	</ul>
		<p>Like a traditional Tracker tab file (<strong>.trk</strong>), a Tracker project file can be opened in Tracker just by double-clicking it. </p>
<p>Since they are self-contained and self-documenting, Tracker project files are the best way to save and share your Tracker projects. With searchable keywords and other metadata, you can browse and find projects easily with the <a href="library_browser.html">Library Browser</a>.</p>
	<p>The figure below shows a typical Tracker project open in the Library Browser. The left pane shows a tree node with the  icon and  title of the project, and the right pane displays an html page with information about the project. The searchable metadata is displayed in a tooltip when   the mouse hovers over a tree node as shown. </p>

	<h3><a name="trz1" id="trz1"></a>1. Preparing for a Tracker project</h3>
	<ol>
	  <ol>
	    <li>Prepare your supporting documents (instructions, report forms, etc).
        </li>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Convert all documents to PDF or HTML.</li>
	      <li>PDF documents will always be displayed in a separate PDF viewer.</li>
	      <li>HTML documents may be displayed in a web browser or in Tracker itself. To display in Tracker, open the experiment's TRK file, add the HTML document to a <a href="../../help/pageview.html" target="_blank">Page View</a> and save the changes.</li>
        </ul>
	    <li>Open one or more tabs in Tracker, confirm that they are in the desired state (seen as the initial state when the project is opened), and save changes. Multiple tabs may be included in a Tracker project. The currently selected tab provides the thumbnail image and is always included.</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
     
	<h3><a name="trz2" id="trz2"></a>2. Building and saving a Tracker project</h3>
	<p>Click the <strong>Save Project</strong> button <img src="../help_images/export_zip_button.gif" alt="Save project button" align="absmiddle"> on the toolbar or choose the <strong>File|Save Project As...</strong> menu item to open a <strong>Tracker Project</strong> window with eight control panes for defining the project properties.  The control panes toggle open and closed with a mouse click and display a property summary when closed. </p>
	<p>When your project is ready click the <strong>Save As...</strong> button  to save it as a Tracker project file (.trz). The tabs, videos and optional support files are zipped together along with automatically generated  thumbnail image and html information files.</p>
	<p align="center"><img src="../help_images/export_zip_dialog.gif" alt="Export ZIP dialog" align="top"></p>
    <h5>Fig. 2 Tracker Project window</h5>
	<p> The control panes open to display additional fields and controls. </p>
	<p>1. <strong>Title</strong>. Enter a title for the project. It should be short but informative. (Note this is NOT a file name--you will choose that when you save the project.) Shown in both the information page and the tree in the Library Browser. Included in searches. (Default: name of the current tab)</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="../help_images/project_title.gif" alt="title pane" vspace="5" align="top"></p>
	  
	  <p>2. <strong>Description</strong>. Enter a brief description of the project. Shown in the information page. To include detailed instructions or reports see Support Files. (Default: none)</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="../help_images/project_description.gif" alt="description pane" vspace="5" align="top"></p>
	  
      <p>3. <strong>Tabs</strong>. Select the tabs you wish to include in the project and enter new names for the tabs if desired. The current tab is always selected. (Default: current tab only, name unchanged)</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="../help_images/project_tabs.gif" alt="tab selection pane" vspace="5" align="top"><br></p>
	  
      <p>4. <strong>Videos</strong>. Check the <strong>Save Clips As</strong> checkbox to trim videos to their current <a href="videos.html#videoclip">video clip</a> or uncheck to include the full original videos in your project. Saving clips  can reduce the file size significantly in many cases. If saving clips, choose a format for the trimmed video from the format dropdown. The JPEG format (image sequence) has the advantage that it can be opened by Tracker even without  a video engine, but can result in larger file sizes. (Default: copy originals)</p>
	    <p align="center"><img src="../help_images/project_videos.gif" alt="video control pane" vspace="5" align="top"></p>
	  
      <p>5. <strong>Metadata</strong>. Enter the project author(s), contact information (e.g. institution, email, etc.) and keywords or phrases. Authors and contact are shown in the information page and all are shown in the tooltip when   the mouse hovers over a tree node. All are included in searches.  It is common, but not required, to separate key phrases with commas. (Default: none)</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="../help_images/project_metadata.gif" alt="metadata pane" vspace="5" align="top"></p>
	  
      <p>6. <strong>Thumbnail</strong>.  Check Preview to display the thumbnail image to be shown in the information page. Click Settings to open a separate dialog that enables you to control the source, size and format of the thumbnail image. (Default: 320 x 240)</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="../help_images/project_thumbnail_preview.gif" alt="thumnnail pane with preview" vspace="5" align="texttop"><img src="../help_images/spacer.gif" vspace="5" align="texttop"><img src="../help_images/thumbnail_dialog.gif" alt="Thumbnail dialog" vspace="5" align="texttop"></p>
	  
      <p>7. <strong>Support Files</strong>. Support files are typically project instructions or reports that open automatically whenever the Tracker project is opened. Click Add to add a support file to your project. You can add as many as you wish but having too many can be confusing when opening the project. To remove a file, select it in the list and click Remove. Most support files are PDF documents or HTML pages but you may also add DOC, TXT and other file types. Images required by HTML support files are automatically included. Note it is NOT necessary to add HTML pages displayed in a Tracker <a href="pageview.html">page view</a>--these are included automatically in the project.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="../help_images/project_support_files.gif" alt="support files pane" vspace="5" align="top"></p>
	  
      <p>8. <strong>Advanced</strong>:  Enter the URL of a web page into the Link field to include a hyperlink to it  in the information page.  To replace the automatically generated information page entirely, click the Open icon and select an external html file to take its place. The title and metadata you have defined will be added to the html code when copying the  file so the Library Browser will still be able to find your project when searching.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="../help_images/project_advanced.gif" alt="advanced pane" vspace="5" align="top"></p>
    
    <h3><a name="zip_sharing" id="zip_sharing"></a>2. Sharing Tracker projects</h3>
    <p>Since Tracker project files (.trz) are  fully self-contained you can <strong>email</strong> them directly to teachers, colleagues or friends. To share with peers in a classroom simply <strong>copy</strong> them to a shared local directory. Any Tracker user with access to your project file can open it with just a double-click.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing on the web</strong> makes your Tracker projects available to  Tracker users worldwide.  There are two ways to do this:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Live collection: </strong>upload the project files to a server along with the <strong>OSP  Digital Library PHP script</strong>. See <a href="library_browser.html#lib6">Library Browser</a> for more information.</li>
  <li><strong>XML collection: </strong>create and edit an xml collection file using the library browser, then upload along with the resources to a server. This gives you the greatest control over the content and organization of your collection. See <a href="library_browser.html#lib6">Library Browser</a> for more information.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>To open a web collection in the library browser</strong>  you need its URL path (e.g.  &quot;http://www.my_institution.edu/my_shared_projects/library_collection.php&quot; or &quot;http://www.my_institution.edu/my_shared_projects/my_collection.xml&quot;). Then do one of the following:</p>
  	      <ol>
          <li>Enter the URL path directly into the <strong>URL</strong> field of the library browser and click the <strong>Load</strong> button. See <a href="library_browser.html">Digital Library Browser</a> for more information.</li>
          <li>Add the URL path to your personal library (&quot;My Library&quot;) and select its menu item in the <strong>Collections|My Library</strong> menu. See <a href="library_browser.html">Digital Library Browser</a> for more information.</li>
          <li>Email the URL path to Douglas Brown (dobrown at cabrillo dot edu) who can (if approved) add it to the <strong>Collections|Shared Library</strong> menu visible to all Tracker users.</li> 
          </ol>
