		<p>A <strong>protractor</strong> track is a tool for measuring angular arcs.  It has a vertex, two arms, an arc arrow and an angle readout that displays either degrees or radians (see <a href="coords.html#units">Setting angle units</a>).</p>
		<p>To create a protractor, click the <strong>Create</strong> button <img src="../help_images/create_button.gif" align="absmiddle"> and choose <strong>Measuring Tools|Protractor</strong> from the popup menu. Multiple protractors can be created as needed.</p>
        
		<h3>1. Measuring an angular arc</h3>
		<p>Click and drag the vertex or circular end of either arm to adjust the arms. The arc arrow shows the direction (cw or ccw) of the arc and the angle readout and toolbar angle field display its value (positive if ccw, negative if cw).</p>
		<p align="center">

            <img src="../help_images/protractor_arm.gif" alt="Protractor dragging arm" align="bottom">
        </p>
		<p>Set the arc to a specific angle by clicking either the angle readout or toolbar field and entering the desired angle.</p>

            <img src="../help_images/protractor_changed.gif" alt="Protractor arc angle set" align="bottom">
        </p>
		<p>Drag the center of either arm to move the entire protractor without changing the angle or orientation.</p>
		<p align="center"><img src="../help_images/protractor_move.gif" alt="Moving protractor"></p>
		<p>Drag the arc arrow to rotate the entire protractor about its vertex without changing the angular arc. For finer control you can drag away from the vertex--a dashed line continues to connect the drag point to the arc arrow as shown.</p>

        </p>
        
		<h3>2. Unfixing the position</strong></h3>
		<p>By default, the protractor has a <strong>fixed position</strong>--that is, its vertex and arm positions are the same in all frames. Uncheck the <strong>Fixed Position</strong> checkbox in its track menu to allow these properties to vary independently from frame to frame.</p>
        
		<h3>3. Measuring the distances and angles between  point masses</h3>
        <p>It is often useful to measure the distances and angles between  independent point mass tracks. This is accomplished most easily by creating a protractor and <strong>attaching</strong> its ends to the point masses. To attach the ends, choose the <strong>Attach Ends</strong> item in the protractor's track menu, then select the desired point mass tracks from the dropdown lists in the Attach Ends dialog.  Attaching the ends automatically unfixes them.</p>

        <h3>4. Locking the protractor</h3>
		<p>Locking the protractor prevents it from making any changes to the scale. Lock the protractor by turning on the <strong>Locked</strong> property in its <a href="tracks.html#trackmenu">track menu</a>.</p>
