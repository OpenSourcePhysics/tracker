		<h1>Tape Measure</h1>
<p align="center"><img src="../help_images/tape.gif" alt="Tape measure"></p>
		<p>A <strong>tape measure</strong> is used for measuring distances and angles. The world (scaled) length of the tape is displayed in a <strong>readout, </strong> in a length field on the toolbar and in data tables. The angle of the tape relative to the +x-axis is displayed on the toolbar and in data tables.</p>
		<p align="center"><img src="../help_images/tape_fields.gif"></p>
		<p>Since a tape measure is a <a href="tracks.html">track</a>, it has a <a href="tracks.html#trackmenu">track menu</a> that is accessible in the Tracks menu on the menu bar or by right-clicking the main video view.</p>
		<p>A <strong>calibration tape</strong> is a tape measure which can be used to calibrate the video scale. For more information, see <a href="stick.html">calibration stick</a>.</p>
        
<h3>1. Creating and using a tape measure</h3>
		<p>To create a tape measure, click the <strong>Create</strong> button <img src="../help_images/create_button.gif" alt="" align="absmiddle" border="0"> and choose <strong>Measuring Tools|Tape Measure</strong> from the popup menu. You can create as many as you need.</p>
		<p>The new tape measure is initially placed slightly above the center of the video image. </p>
		<p align="center"><img src="../help_images/tape_initial.gif"></p>
		<p>To measure distances, drag either end of the tape. To move the entire tape as a unit, drag the middle.</p>
		<p align="center">

            <img src="../help_images/spacer.gif">
            <img src="../help_images/tape_selected.gif" alt="Tape measure dragging middle">
    </p>
		<p>To set the length, either (a) select the tape measure and enter the desired value in the toolbar field, or (b) double-click the tape readout and enter the desired length.</p>

        <p>To set the angle, select the tape measure and enter the desired value in the toolbar field.</p>
        <p align="center"> <img src="../help_images/tape_set_angle.gif" alt=""></p>
        
<h3>2. Unfixing the position</h3>
		<p>By default, the tape measure has a <strong>fixed position</strong>--that is, the position of both ends is the same in all frames. Uncheck the <strong>Fixed Position</strong> checkbox in its track menu to allow the position to vary independently from frame to frame.</p>
        
<h3>3. Measuring the distance between two point masses</h3>
<p>It is often useful to measure the distance between two point mass tracks. This is accomplished most easily by creating a tape measure and <strong>attaching</strong>  its ends to the point masses. To attach the ends, choose the <strong>Attach Ends</strong> item in the tape's track menu, then select the desired point mass tracks from the dropdown lists in the Attach Ends dialog. Attaching the ends automatically unfixes them.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../help_images/attach_tape.gif" alt="Attach Ends dialog"></p>
<h3>4. Locking the tape measure</h3>
	<p>Locking the tape measure prevents any changes in its end positions. Lock the tape by turning on the <strong>Locked</strong> property in its <a href="tracks.html#trackmenu">track menu</a>.</p>
		<p>Note that if the scale of the video changes, the tape readout will show a different world length even though the end positions of the tape have not changed.</p>
