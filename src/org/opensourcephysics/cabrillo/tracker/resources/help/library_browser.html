		<h1><a name="lib0" id="lib0"></a>Digital Library Browser</h1>
		<p>The Digital Library Browser (&quot;DL browser&quot;) enables users to browse and search collections of  <strong>library resources</strong> such as videos and Tracker experiments, including <a href="zip_resource.html">Tracker ZIP files</a>. Collections may be located on a local drive or remote server.</p>
		<p>When a resource of interest is found, it  can be immediately opened in Tracker with just a double-click.</p>
<p align="center"> <img src="../help_images/library_browser.gif" alt="OSP Digital Library Browser"> </p>

<h3><a name="lib1" id="lib1"></a>1. Opening a collection</h3>
<p>Opening a collection displays it in a <strong>tab</strong> with a tree  in the left pane and an HTML page in the right pane as shown above. The title of the tab is the name of the root node of the collection.</p>
<p>There are three ways to open a collection:</p>
  <p align="center"> 
  <img src="../help_images/library_browser_collections_menu.gif" alt="Library browser collections menu" align="top">
            <img src="../help_images/spacer.gif">
    <img src="../help_images/library_browser_open.gif" alt="Library browser open menu" align="top">
  </p>
  <p align="center"><img src="../help_images/library_browser_toolbar_load.gif" alt="Library browser loading URL on toolbar" align="absmiddle"></p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose a collection by name from the <strong>Collections</strong> menu or <strong>File|Open Recent</strong> menu.</li>
  <li>Choose the <strong>File|Open...</strong> menu item and use the file chooser to open a library resource or collection on a local drive. Collections may be either:</li>
  
  	    <ol type="a">  
        <li><strong>Directories</strong> containing OSP resources. The  library resources in the directory are displayed in the tree.</li>
        <li><strong>XML documents</strong> previously saved by the DL browser.</li>
	    </ol>  
  
  <li>Enter a collection  path directly into the toolbar <strong>URL</strong> field as with a web browser.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="browse" id="browse"></a>2. Library resources</h3>
<p>Each  node in a collection tree represents a library resource or subcollection and has the following properties:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Name</strong>: identifies the resource. Displayed as the node name in the tree.</li>
  <li><strong>Type</strong>:  may be <em>Collection, Tracker experiment, EJS model, Video, Image, HTML page, PDF document, </em>or<em> Other</em>. Displayed as the node icon in the tree.</li>
  <li><strong>HTML page</strong>: describes the resource and provides links to additional information. Displayed in the right pane when the node is selected. If no HTML page is defined, the right pane displays the node name, type and (for videos) thumbnail image.</li>
  <li><strong>Metadata</strong>: searchable author names, contact information and keywords. Displayed in the tooltip when the mouse hovers over the node.</li>
  <li><strong>Target</strong>: the resource file itself. Displayed  in the URL field on the toolbar when the node is selected. Opened in Tracker (and/or  HTML browser or PDF viewer) when the node is double-clicked or the toolbar <strong>Load</strong> button is clicked. Some nodes (e.g. collection nodes) have no target.</li>
</ol>

<p>A <strong>Tracker ZIP file</strong> is a library resource that consists of a  zip file containing an entire Tracker experiment, including tracker file, video clip, HTML/PDF documentation and metadata. Using Tracker to create a Tracker ZIP file is the easiest and most convenient way to package and share a Tracker experiment. For more information see <a href="zip_resource,html">Tracker ZIP Files</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="lib3" id="lib3"></a>3. The OSP cache</h3>
<p>In order to increase performance and provide a searchable database, some files are stored in the Open Source Physics (OSP) cache on the local machine when collections are opened in the DL browser.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Searchable XML documents that describe the collections and contain references to the actual resource files.</li>
  <li>HTML pages (and associated images) extracted from ZIP resources.</li>
  <li>Thumbnail images of videos and ComPADRE Digital Library resources.</li>
  <li>Library resource target files that are downloaded from the web when loading into Tracker.</li>
</ol>
<p>Choose the <strong>Manage|Cache...</strong> menu item to view the status of the OSP cache in the <strong>Library Manager</strong>. Click a <strong>Clear</strong> button to clear cached HTML pages, thumbnails and OSP resources from a particular server. Click the Clear All button to clear the entire cache. <strong>Note</strong>: searchable cached XML documents are managed separately, and are NOT deleted when clearing the cache.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="../help_images/library_manager_cache.gif" alt="Library manager displaying cache tab"></p>
  <p>Reopening a web-based collection that has been previously cached does NOT reload the collection from the web but instead opens the cached XML file. This speeds up the process considerably. To delete the cached XML file and reload the web collection from its source, select the root node and click the Refresh button <img src="../help_images/refresh_button.gif" alt="refresh button" align="absmiddle"> on the toolbar. Local collections are always opened directly, not from the cache. </p>

<h3><a name="lib4" id="lib4"></a>4. Searching for resources</h3>
<p>To search for resources enter a search term or phrase into the toolbar <strong>Search</strong> field. Search terms are compared with resource names, resource types, author names, contact information, keywords and other metadata defined by a resource. Search terms are case-insensitive but must be matched in their entirety. <strong>Note</strong>: only resources defined in  searchable cached XML documents can be discovered. For this reason, it is recommended that you open all collections of interest when first using the DL browser (be sure to leave them open long enough to fully load and save themselves in the cache--for some collections this can take several minutes).</p>
<p>Search results are displayed in a new tab.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../help_images/library_browser_search_results.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>The tree nodes displayed in the search results are fully functional--that is, you can browse or open them in Tracker in the usual way. But it is often useful to open them in their original collections which may contain related resources. To open a search result in its original collection, right-click the node and choose <strong>Show Original</strong> from the popup menu.</p>
<p>To fine-tune your search you can use the logic operators AND and OR (must be upper case) in your search phrase. When using more than one logic operator you should include parentheses for clarification (e.g. &quot;yo-yo OR (disk AND energy)&quot;). The search terms separated by these operators are used independently as described above, then the independent results are combined logically to obtain the final search results.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../help_images/library_browser_toolbar_searchOR.gif" alt="Library Browser entering search phrase with OR operator"></p>
<p>Choose the <strong>Manage|Search Targets...</strong> menu item to control which cached XML documents are searched in the <strong>Library Manager</strong>. Click a checkbox to include or exclude a collection, or click  <strong>Select All</strong> or <strong>Select None</strong> for faster control. You can delete an unwanted XML file from the cache by clicking its <strong>Delete</strong> button.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../help_images/library_manager_search.gif" alt="Library manager displaying search tab"></p>

<h3><a name="lib5" id="lib5"></a>5. Managing collections</h3>
<p>The DL browser provides direct access to collections in the following digital libraries, available in the <strong>Collections</strong> menu:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A local library called <strong>My Library,</strong> managed by the user and discussed in this section.</li>
  <li>The <a href="library_browser.html#compadre"><strong>ComPADRE Digital Library</strong></a>, a part of the National Science Digital Library system.</li>
  <li>The<strong> Tracker Home Library</strong>, managed by Douglas Brown, author of Tracker.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Shared Library</strong> containing collections contributed by other educators and students. To find out how to share your own collections, see<a href="library_browser.html#compadre">Building the shared and ComPADRE libraries</a>. </li>
</ol>
<p>My Library initially contains a single local collection called <strong>My Collection</strong> to which the user can add resources as described in <a href="library_browser.html#sharing">Editing local collections</a> below. But it is easy to customize My Library by adding your own favorite collections.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../help_images/library_browser_my_library.gif" alt="My Library menu"></p>
<p>There are two ways to add a collection to My Library:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the  collection of interest in a tab, then right-click the tab and choose <strong>Add this to My Library</strong> from the popup menu. You will be prompted to assign the collection a name for the Collections menu.</li>
  <li>Choose the <strong>Manage|My Library...</strong> menu item to open the <strong>Library Manager</strong>, then click the <strong>Add</strong> button and enter the collection URL in the Add Collection dialog. You will be prompted to assign the collection a name for the Collections menu.</li>
</ol>    
<p align="center"><img src="../help_images/library_manager_my_library.gif" alt="Library manager displaying My Library tab"></p>

<p>The Library Manager also enables you to rename, reorder and/or remove collections from My Library. To rename a collection, select it and edit the name in the <strong>Name</strong> field. To reorder or remove a collection, select it and use the buttons provided. <strong>Note</strong>: renaming a collection changes only its menu name, not its tab title.</p>
<h3><a name="lib6" id="lib6"></a>6. Creating resources and collections</h3>
<p><strong>Resources</strong>: library resources may have the following targets:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Tracker experiments</strong>: TRK tracker file or ZIP file containing a tracker file. Associated video and/or <a href="pageview.html">page view</a> HTML files must accompany the target. Opened in Tracker.</li>
  <li><strong>Videos and images</strong>: video or image file. Opened in Tracker.</li>
  <li><strong>HTML pages</strong>: HTML file. Opened in the default HTML browser.</li>
  <li><strong>PDF documents</strong>: PDF file. Opened in the default PDF viewer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Collections</strong>: there are two types of collections, <strong>live</strong> and <strong>XML</strong>. Live collections are views of resource files in a single directory (with subdirectories if desired). XML collections are XML documents with references to resource files which can be anywhere, including other servers.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Live collections</strong>: This is the easiest option.</li>
    <ol type="a">
  <li><strong>Local</strong>: put the resource targets into a  local directory and open the directory in the DL browser. <strong>Optional but recommended</strong>: add HTML information files to the same directory (see below).</li>
  <li><strong>Web</strong>: put the resource targets along with the OSP <strong> Digital Library PHP script</strong> into a directory on a server (see <a href="http://www.cabrillo.edu/~dbrown/tracker/library/_share/sharing.html">Sharing Your Tracker Collection</a>) and open the URL path to the script in the DL browser.   <strong>Optional but recommended</strong>: add HTML information files to the server directory (see below). <strong>Note</strong>: the server must  run the PHP script. You may have to change the script  extension. Check with your web administrator if unsure. </li>
    </ol>
  
  <li><strong>XML collections</strong>: This is the most flexible option.</li>

    <ol type="a">
      <li>Use <strong>File|New Collection...</strong> to create a new empty XML collection or  <strong>File|Save Collection As...</strong> to create an XML copy of an open collection.</li>
      <li>Edit the XML collection as described in <a href="library_browser.html#editing">Editing XML collections</a>.</li>
      <li>To share the XML collection on the web, see <a href="library_browser.html#sharing">Uploading XML collections to the web</a>.</li>
      <li>Open the URL path to the XML file in the DL browser.</li>
    </ol>
</ol>
<h3><a name="html_info" id="html_info"></a>7. HTML information files for live collections</h3>
    <p>Resources in live collections (with the notable exception of <a href="zip_resource.html">Tracker ZIP files</a>) will have minimal documentation and  metadata unless you add correctly named and coded HTML information files to the same directory. For effective HTML information files, use the following guidelines:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Filename</strong>: strip the extension and append &quot;_info.html&quot; to the name of the PHP script or resource target file (e.g.  &quot;<em>library_collection_info.html</em>&quot; for  script &quot;<em>library_collection.php</em>&quot;, &quot;<em>wheels_info.html</em>&quot; for local directory &quot;<em>wheels</em>&quot;, &quot;<em>loop2_info.html</em>&quot; for tracker file &quot;<em>loop2.trk</em>&quot; or video file &quot;<em>loop2.flv</em>&quot;).</li>
      <li><strong>Title</strong>: set the &lt;title&gt;  in the HTML &lt;head&gt; section to the desired resource or collection name (e.g. <em>&lt;title&gt;Modeling a Hot Wheels Loop&lt;/title&gt;</em>).</li>
      <li><strong>Metadata</strong>: add a &lt;meta&gt; tag in the HTML &lt;head&gt; section for each type of metadata you wish to include. For example:</li>
      	<blockquote>
          <em>&lt;meta name=&quot;author&quot; content=&quot;Douglas Brown&quot;&gt;<br>&lt;meta name=&quot;contact&quot; content=&quot;Cabrillo College&quot;&gt;<br>&lt;meta name=&quot;keywords&quot; content=&quot;circular motion, centripetal acceleration, toy truck, Newton's second law&quot;&gt;</em>
        </blockquote>
      
      <li><strong>Body</strong>: include a brief description of the collection or resource, including image and hyperlinks if desired. Remember that the HTML pane in the DL browser may be small. Extensive documentation and/or instructions should be in separate HTML and/or PDF resources.</li>    
      </ol>
    <h3><a name="editing" id="editing"></a>8. Editing XML collections</h3>
		<p>An XML collection saved on a local drive is  editable by default unless it has been set to read-only by the operating system.</p>
        <p>To edit a local collection, open it in the DL browser and click the <strong>Open Editor</strong> button on  the toolbar.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="../help_images/library_browser_toolbar_edit.gif" alt="Library Browser Open Editor button"></p>
<p>The editor displays (a) a button bar for creating and organizing resource nodes and (b) data fields for describing and defining the resources themselves.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../help_images/library_browser_editing.gif" alt="Library Browser with collection editor open"></p>
<p><strong>Button bar:</strong> the button bar provides the following buttons:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Add Resource</strong> and <strong>Add Collection</strong> (available only when a collection node is selected): click to add a new resource or subcollection node to the selected node.</li>
  <li><strong>Copy Node</strong> and <strong>Cut Node</strong>: click to copy or cut the selected node to the clipboard. Note: the only way to delete a node is to cut it.</li>
  <li><strong>Paste Node</strong> (available only when a collection node is selected): click to add the clipboard node to the selected node.</li>
  <li><strong>Move Up</strong> and <strong>Move Down</strong>: click to change the position of the selected node.</li>
  <li><strong>Show Metadata</strong>: click to show the metadata fields.</li>
</ul>
<p>These button actions can also be executed by right-clicking a node and selecting the action from the popup menu. Note: the <strong>Copy Node</strong> action is available by right-clicking any node in any collection, even when not editing. This enables users to easily add any resource to their own collection.</p>
<p><strong>Data fields:</strong> the data fields display the following resource properties:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Name</strong>: the node name displayed in the tree.</li>
  <li><strong>Type</strong>: the type of resource. May be <em>Collection, Tracker Experiment</em>, <em>EJS Model</em>, <em>Video</em>, <em>Image, HTML Page</em>, <em>PDF Document</em>, or <em>Other</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>HTML File</strong> (optional): the path to the file displayed in the HTML pane when the node is selected. The path may be absolute or relative to the base URL (<a href="library_browser.html#paths">see discussion below</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Base URL</strong> (optional): the base URL used to resolve relative paths for the HTML and resource files.</li>
  <li><strong>Resource</strong> (disabled for collection nodes): the path to the resource target file. The path may be absolute or relative to the base URL (<a href="library_browser.html#paths">see discussion below</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Metadata fields:</strong> clicking the Show Metadata button displays the following additional fields (not shown in the figure above):</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Author</strong>: the authors of the experiment.</li>
  <li><strong>Contact</strong>: contact information for the authors (e.g. institution, email, etc.).</li>
  <li><strong>Keywords</strong>: searchable keywords and phrases. It is common, but not required, to separate key phrases with commas.</li>
  <li><strong>Metadata</strong> (dropdown list of metadata names and values): additional metadata names and values of any kind can be entered here.</li>
  </ul>
<p>To view the metadata defined for a resource without showing the metadata fields, hover  over the node with the mouse to display the tooltip.</p>
<h3><a name="paths" id="paths"></a>9. Absolute and relative paths in XML collections</h3>
        <p>In the collection editor, resource and HTML paths may be entered as absolute or relative to the base URL. In general, relative paths are preferable for the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The base URL can be defined for an entire collection or subcollection. Child resources inherit the parent base URL automatically, making it unnecessary to re-enter a path repeatedly. When a resource inherits from its parent the path is displayed in a pale green color as shown in the figure above. To override the parent, simply enter a new path in the Base URL field.</li>
          <li>It is  faster, easier and more accurate to enter and read short (relative) resource and HTML file names.</li>
          <li>If the actual resource and HTML files are stored in a directory structure that can be moved and/or uploaded as a unit, then the entire collection file can be updated by changing only the base URL(s).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To convert an absolute path to relative (or vice-versa), right-click the Resource or HTML File field and choose <strong>Set to relative</strong> (or <strong>Set to absolute</strong>) from the popup menu.</p>
        <h3><a name="sharing" id="sharing"></a>10. Uploading XML collections to the web</h3>
    <p>XML collections can only be created, edited and saved on a local drive. But by uploading your resources to the web and changing the base URL of your collection, your XML  collection becomes completely portable--you may email the XML file to others, post it on the web or share it on a local network.</p>
    <p>To put your  local collection on the web, open the XML file in the DL browser and follow these steps (this assumes you have assembled your resource target and HTML files locally and used relative paths in the collection editor as described above):</p>
    <ol>
            <li>Identify  the server directory you will use for your web collection (e.g. &quot;<em>www.my_institution.edu/my_shared_experiments</em>&quot;).</li>
            <li>Upload your library resource files (including subdirectories, if any) to the server directory.</li>
            <li>Open the collection editor, and select the root node.</li>
            <li>Change the base URL to the server  directory URL path (e.g. &quot;<em>http://www.my_institution.edu/my_shared_experiments</em>&quot;).</li>
            <li>If needed, change the base URL of other subcollections or resources in your collection.</li>
            <li>Browse your collection to verify that the web resources are available and behaving as expected.</li>
            <li>Save the modified XML collection file (or <strong>Save As</strong> to preserve the original).</li>
    </ol>
<h3><a name="compadre" id="compadre"></a>11. Building the Shared and ComPADRE libraries</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Shared Library</strong> contains collections contributed by other Tracker users, and we encourage you to help build the library by developing and hosting web-based collections (Tracker experiments and/or videos) and emailing the collection path to the Shared Library editor, Douglas Brown (dobrown at cabrillo dot edu). Collections that are added to the library are immediately available from the <strong>Collections|Shared Library</strong> menu visible to all Tracker users.</p>
        <p>The <strong>ComPADRE Digital Library</strong>, a part of the National Science Digital Library system, is a growing network of educational resource collections supporting teachers and students in Physics and Astronomy. As a user you may explore collections designed to meet your specific needs and help build the network by recommending resources, commenting on resources, and starting or joining discussions. For more information, see &lt;<b><a href="http://www.compadre.org/OSP/">http://www.compadre.org/OSP/</a></b>&gt;. To recommend an OSP resource for ComPADRE, visit the Suggest a Resource page at &lt;<b><a href="http://www.compadre.org/osp/items/suggest.cfm">http://www.compadre.org/osp/items/suggest.cfm</a></b>&gt;. Contact the OSP Collection editor, Wolfgang Christian, for additional information.</p>
