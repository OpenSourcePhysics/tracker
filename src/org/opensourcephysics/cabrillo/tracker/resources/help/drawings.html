        <p>An <strong>annotation drawing</strong> consists of one or more lines and an optional label that are displayed directly on the video to <strong>annotate</strong> a tracker experiment.</p>
        
    <h3><a name="draw1" id="draw1"></a>1. Drawing Control</h3>
            <p>Click the pencil on the drawing button <img src="../help_images/drawing_button.gif" alt="Drawing button" align="absmiddle"> (near the right end of the toolbar) to open the <strong>Drawing Control</strong> and enable drawing. When the Drawing Control is open you can draw lines on the video by dragging the mouse (pencil cursor), control the color and other properties of the drawing, and reposition labels by dragging them with the mouse. When done drawing simply close the Drawing Control.</p>

    <h3><a name="draw2" id="draw2"></a>2. Drawing properties</h3>
        <p>Every drawing has the following properties:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>A <strong>start</strong> and <strong>end</strong> frame that define its visibility. By default the start frame is the current video frame when the drawing is created and the end frame is the last frame in the video.</li>
          <li>An optional <strong>label</strong> with a settable <strong>font size</strong>. </li>
          <li>A <strong>color</strong> that applies to both the lines and label. Click a color box to select the color.</li>
          <li>A <strong>style</strong> that can be heavy or light. Heavy drawings have wide lines and bold fonts.</li>
    </ol>
            <p align="center">
                <img src="../help_images/drawing_light.gif" alt="Light style">

    <h3><a name="draw3" id="draw3"></a>3. Creating and deleting drawings</h3>
        <p>When the Drawing Control is first opened a new blank drawing will be automatically created and displayed as shown in Fig. 1. The drawing is identified by its label and frame range.</p>
        <p>Click the New button in the Drawing Control to create additional drawings. Click the Delete button to delete the current drawing or the Clear All button to delete all drawings.</p>

        <h3><a name="draw5" id="draw5"></a>5. Labels</h3>
        <p>Create a label by entering text into the label field. New labels are positioned in the center of the current view. Drag the label with the mouse (while in drawing mode) to reposition it.</p>

        <p>To hide all drawings, click the right side of the drawing button (small arrow) and uncheck the <strong>Drawings Visible</strong> checkbox.
