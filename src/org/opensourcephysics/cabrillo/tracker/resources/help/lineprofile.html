		<p>A <strong>line profile</strong> track is a tool for measuring brightness and rgb data along a line on a video image. If the line width is increased by adding <strong>spread</strong>, image pixels above and below the line are averaged in order to reduce noise and/or increase sensitivity.</p>
        
		<h3><a name="profile1" id="profile1"></a>1. Marking the line</h3>
		<p align="center">

		</p>
		<p>Shift-drag the mouse to mark a line profile. The line is drawn as a narrow rectangle that surrounds the pixel points analyzed by the line profile tool.</p>
		<p>Drag either end of the line to change its length. Drag the center of the line to position it.</p>

		<h3><a name="profile2" id="profile2"></a>2. Adding spread</h3>
		<p align="center">
			<img src="../help_images/line_profile_spread.gif">
		</p>
		<p>To increase the number of pixels sampled for a smoother average you can give the line profile a <strong>spread</strong>. Select the line and enter the desired spread in pixels in the field on the toolbar.</p>
		<p>The spread pixels extend to both sides of the line. Thus, for a given data point on the line, the total number of pixels sampled (i.e., width of the line profile) is 1 + 2*spread. The outline of the line profile shows all pixels included in the average.</p>

		<h3><a name="profile3" id="profile3"></a>3. Line orientation</h3>
		<p>By default, a line profile has a <strong>horizontal orientation</strong>--that is, parallel to the top or bottom edge of the video image. Setting an <strong>x-axis orientation</strong> by selecting the <strong>Along X-Axis</strong> item in its track menu will instead cause the line to remain parallel to the x-axis. This is useful when measuring spectra that have been inadvertently captured with a tilted camera, for example.</p>

		<h3><a name="profile4" id="profile4"></a>4. Unfixing the line</h3>
		<p>By default, the line profile has a <strong>fixed position</strong>--that is, its center position and length are the same in all frames. Uncheck the <strong>Fixed Position</strong> checkbox in its <a href="tracks.html#trackmenu">track menu</a> to allow these properties to vary independently from frame to frame. </p>
