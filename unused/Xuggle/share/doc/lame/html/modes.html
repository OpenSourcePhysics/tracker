<H1>CBR/ABR/VBR: the 3 encoding modes</H1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LAME is able to encode your music using one of its 3 encoding modes: constant 
  bitrate (CBR), average bitrate (ABR) and variable bitrate (VBR).<br>
  <br>
  <br>
</p>
<h2>Constant Bitrate (CBR)</h2>
<p>This is the default encoding mode, and also the most basic. In this mode, the 
  bitrate will be the same for the whole file. It means that each part of your 
  mp3 file will be using the same number of bits. The musical passage beeing a 
  difficult one to encode or an easy one, the encoder will use the same bitrate, 
  so the quality of your mp3 is variable. Complex parts will be of a lower quality 
  than the easiest ones. The main advantage is that the final files size won't 
  change and can be accurately predicted.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<h2>Average Bitrate (ABR)</h2>
<p>In this mode, you choose a target bitrate and the encoder will try to constantly 
  maintain an average bitrate while using higher bitrates for the parts of your 
  music that need more bits. The result will be of higher quality than CBR encoding 
  while the average file size will remain predictible, so this mode is highly 
  recommended over CBR.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<h2>Variable bitrate (VBR)</h2>
<p>In this mode, you choose the desired quality on a scale going from 9 (lowest 
  quality/highest distortion) to 0 (highest quality/lowest distortion). Then encoder 
  tries to maintain the given quality in the whole file by choosing the optimal 
  number of bits to spend for each part of your music. The main advantage is that 
  you are able to specify the quality level that you want to reach, but the inconvenient 
  is that the final file size is totally unpredictible.</p>
