# a semicolon-separated list of packages that contain classes for which the method names
# in their classes should not be "qualified" to indicate their parameter types. 
# This option is useful if you have an API interface in Java that refers to JavaScript 
# methods such as calling window or jQuery functions or the methods in Clazz or J2S. 
# The classes must not have any methods that are overloaded - with the
# same name but different paramater type, as JavaScript will only see the last one.

# a semicolon-separated list of from->to listings of package (foo.) or class (foo.bar) 
# replacements to be made. This option allows for having one class or package used in Java
# and another used in JavaScript. Take care with this. All methods in both packages must
# have exactly the same parameter signature. We use it in Jalview to provide a minimal
# JavaScript implementation of a large third-party library while still using that library's
# jar file in Java.

# in your project directory. A default template file will be created by the transpiler 
# directory if there is none there already.
